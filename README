INTRO

XBMC service addon that allows ampserver to control from within XBMC in a semi automated matter

REQUIREMENTS

Ampserver is a service addon and requires XBMC 'eden' which is currently only available from git. See http://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.
Ampserver must be running before XBMC starts with addon.

INSTALL

Run the ampserver.py in the background (needs to be started before xbmc runs)
Place in ~/.xbmc/addons/

I recommend you then place the included keyboard.xml in ~/.xbmc/userdata/. This will map u/d keys on the keyboard to control the amplifier volume and the volume keys on the android remote or other remotes to also do the same. Note no UI notification will be given and the response time is not brilliant

FUNCTIONALITY

On video/audio start amp will be poweredon.
On media type change (video -> audio) or (audio -> video) volume will be modified. I like the play videos louder than music.
On XBMC screensaver start (or blackout) and no media is playing, amplifier will be turned off
