INTRO

XBMC service addon that allows ampserver to control from within XBMC in a semi automated matter

REQUIREMENTS

Ampserver is a service addon and requires XBMC 'eden' which is currently only available from git. See http://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.
Ampserver must be running before XBMC starts with addon.

INSTALL

Run the ampserver.py in the background (needs to be started before xbmc runs)
Place in ~/.xbmc/addons/

FUNCTIONALITY

On video/audio start amp will be poweredon.
On media type change (video -> audio) or (audio -> video) volume will be modified. I like the play videos louder than music.
On XBMC screensaver start (or blackout) and no media is playing, amplifier will be turned off
