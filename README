INTRO

XBMC service addon that allows rs232server to control from within XBMC in a semi automated matter

REQUIREMENTS

rs232server is a service addon and requires XBMC 11.x 'Eden'. Note this is only tested on x86 XBMC 12.x on Linux.
rs232server must be running before XBMC starts with addon.

INSTALL

Run the rs232_server.py in the background (needs to be started before xbmc runs)
Place in ~/.xbmc/addons/

FUNCTIONALITY

On video/audio start amp will be poweredon.
On media type change (video -> audio) or (audio -> video) volume will be modified. I like the play videos louder than music.
On XBMC screensaver start (or blackout) and no media is playing, amplifier will be turned off
